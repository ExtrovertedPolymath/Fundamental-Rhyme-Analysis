# ðŸ§  Project FRA - Sonic Proximity Score (SPS) Model v1.2

This Python library computes a "Sonic Proximity Score" (SPS) between IPA phonemes using a vector-based articulatory feature model.

### ðŸ†• Version 1.2
- âœ… Refactored distance formula: `SPS = 1 - (d / d_max)`
- âœ… Added non-pulmonic consonants: clicks, implosives, ejectives
- âœ… Supports consonants and vowels in a unified interface
